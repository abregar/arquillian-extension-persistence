== Meet APE

This is a new version of Arquillian Persistence Extension, which will be called APE from now on (because we take care of tasks which monkeys can do for you ;)).

We are working on quite a bunch of new features:

* Support for NoSQL databases
* Support for interacting with REST endpoints (through Postman)
* Standalone DBUnit support (not required to run in application server, a.k.a. in-container)

== Migration from Arquillian Persistence Extension 1.x to 2.x

If you are using version 1.x for your in-container JPA tests jumping to 2.x train is fairly easy.

First of all change your old dependency

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.jboss.arquillian.extension</groupId>
    <artifactId>arquillian-persistence-dbunit</artifactId>
    <version>${version.arquillian.persistence}</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
----

to

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.arquillian.ape</groupId>
  <artifactId>arquillian-ape-sql-container-dbunit</artifactId>
  <version>${version.ape}</version>
  <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
----

Then you will have to rename packages, as we changed the namespace from `org.jboss.arquillian.persistence` to `org.arquillian.ape.rdbms`. For example `org.jboss.arquillian.persistence.UsingDataSet` becomes `org.arquillian.ape.rdbms.UsingDataSet`.

NOTE: `@DataSet` annotations will be still subject of change, as we will also provide support for them for tests which are not in-container and DBUnit specific.

== Overview

NOTE: This is still Work In Progress. Documentation below captures only functionalities of Arquillian Persistence Extension 1.x. We will be publishing new documentation together with version `2.0.0`, till then please have a look at functional tests in the project.

[[what-is-this]]
=== What Is This?

*Arquillian Persistence Extension* was created to help you write tests
where persistence layer is involved. Inspired by great framework called
http://unitils.org/[Unitils], it brings a bunch of annotations to help you
deal with the underlying data storage.

It comes with following features:

* Wrapping each test in the separated transaction (with
**commit** (default) or *rollback* at the end).
* Seeding database using:
** http://dbunit.sourceforge.net/[DBUnit] with **XML**, **XLS**, *YAML*
and *JSON* supported as data sets format.
** Custom SQL scripts.
* Comparing database state at the end of the test using given data sets
(with column exclusion).
* Eviction JPA second level cache between test method invocation, see
`@JpaCacheEviction`.

[[containers-used-for-testing]]
=== Containers Used For Testing

* Glassfish 3.1.2 Embedded
* JBoss AS 7.0.2 Final (managed)
* JBoss AS 7.1.1.Final (managed)
* Wildfly 8.1


[[verified-with-following-databases]]
=== Verified With Following Databases

* HSQL
* MS SQL 2008 Express (with Microsoft JDBC Driver)
* MySQL 5.5.24
* PostgreSQL 9.1.4
* Oracle 11g
* Derby

*Enough talking, let's see it in action!*

[[code-example]]
=== Code Example

[source,java]
----
@ExtendWith(ArquillianExtension.class)
public class UserPersistenceTest
{

  @Deployment
  public static Archive<?> createDeploymentPackage()
  {
      return ShrinkWrap.create(JavaArchive.class, "test.jar")
                       .addPackage(UserAccount.class.getPackage())
                       .addPackages(true, "org.fest") // FEST Assert is not part of Arquillian
                       .addAsManifestResource(EmptyAsset.INSTANCE, "beans.xml")
                       .addAsManifestResource("test-persistence.xml", "persistence.xml");
  }

  @PersistenceContext
  EntityManager em;

  @Test
  @UsingDataSet("datasets/users.yml")
  @ShouldMatchDataSet("datasets/expected-users.yml")
  public void should_change_user_password() throws Exception
  {
      // given
      String expectedPassword = "LexLuthor";
      UserAccount user = em.find(UserAccount.class, 2L);

      // when
      user.setPassword("LexLuthor");
      em.merge(user);

      // then
      assertThat(user.getPassword()).isEqualTo(expectedPassword);
  }
}
----

There are just two things which are different from the standard
Arquillian test - `@UsingDataSet` and `@ShouldMatchDataSet` annotations.
Former seeds the database using file in YAML format, and latter verifies
database state using given file.

This example is taken from *integration tests* written for this project,
so feel free to have a closer look.

But it's that easy! And there's more to come!

If you have any questions or would like to file feature request or bug
report (hope not!) please have a look at
http://arquillian.org/community/[the ways how you can get in touch with
us].
